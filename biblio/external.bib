abstract = {A backbone network of road side units (RSUs) is an essential part of modern intelligent transportation systems, where the roadside units are used to collect and distribute information among the mobile users. Connecting each RSU to the data center or Internet is not always feasible due to location and cost constraints. When the RSUs are located close enough to each other, they can be connected via a multihop wireless network where they play a role of the wireless routers. In this paper we consider a partial case when the roadside units are connected in a wireless network with linear topology. Each RSU is equipped with IEEE 802.11 access point that is used by the mobile users to send their data via the network, and with a relay equipment that allows the RSU to connect to the neighbouring RSUs. Each station type is defined by the coverage radius of the access point, connection distance of the relay links and the station price. We also assume that the road has several possible discrete locations where the stations can be deployed. The problem is to find out which stations should be deployed to maximize the overall coverage while providing the given solution cost. First, we formulate the problem in combinatorial form and use this formulation to prove NP-hardness of the problem. Then we define an integer linear program that can be used to find the optimal solution using a well-known software like GLPK or CPLEX.},

@article{Wu2017,
abstract = {Tandem queues with finite buffer capacity commonly exist in practical applications. By viewing a tandem queue as an integrated system, an innovative approach has been developed to analyze its performance through insight from Friedman's reduction method. In our approach, the starvation at the bottleneck caused by service time randomness is modeled by interruptions. Fundamental properties of tandem queues with finite buffer capacity are examined. Without the assumptions of phase-type distributions and stochastic independence, we show that, in general, the system service rate of a tandem queue with a finite buffer capacity is equal to or smaller than its bottleneck service rate, and virtual interruptions, which are the extra idle period at the bottleneck caused by the non-bottlenecks, depend on arrival rates. Hence, the system service rate is a function of arrival rates when the buffer capacity of a tandem queue is finite. Approximations for the mean queue time of a dual tandem queue are developed using the concept of virtual interruptions.},

@article{Bendel2018,
abstract = {We consider a tandem network of queues with a Poisson arrival process to the first queue. Service times are assumed to be exponential. In cases where they are not, we additionally assume a processor sharing service discipline in all servers. Consecutive servers may cooperate by pooling resources which leads to the formation of a single combined server that satisfies the aggregated service demands with a greater service rate. On this basis we define a cooperative game with transferable utility, where the cost of a coalition is the steady-state mean total number of customers in the system formed by its members. We show that the game is subadditive, leading to full cooperation being socially optimal. We then show the non-emptiness of the core, despite the characteristic function being neither monotone, nor concave. Finally, we derive several well-known solution concepts, including the Shapley value, the Banzhaf, value and the nucleolus, for the case where servers have equal mean service demands. In particular, we show that all three values coincide in this case.},

RSUs have a critical role in safety applications but also in infotainment applications. Hence, spreading RSUs should pay attention to cover with its best effort the dark zones and to serve the biggest number of vehicles with continuous services while remaining in the range of the deployment budget. To reach our objectives, we consider stationary and mobility-based statistics to model our traffic network as a graph with weighted links showing the importance of each link in terms of amount of vehicles, hazardous level, and mobility-based parameters such as average of connected time based on speed information. Then, all the potential positions are designated and two different algorithms, Knapsack and PageRank, are applied to select the optimal set of RSU positions within the cost range. Finally the output set of each algorithm is evaluated against real traffic records and statistics to show the network performance.},

abstract = {Pipelines are widely used for the transportation of hydrocarbon fluids over millions of miles all over the world. The structures of the pipelines are designed to withstand several environmental loading conditions to ensure safe and reliable distribution from point of production to the shore or distribution depot. However, leaks in pipeline networks are one of the major causes of innumerable losses in pipeline operators and nature. Incidents of pipeline failure can result in serious ecological disasters, human casualties and financial loss. In order to avoid such menace and maintain safe and reliable pipeline infrastructure, substantial research efforts have been devoted to implementing pipeline leak detection and localisation using different approaches. This paper discusses pipeline leakage detection technologies and summarises the state-of-the-art achievements. Different leakage detection and localisation in pipeline systems are reviewed and their strengths and weaknesses are highlighted. Comparative performance analysis is performed to provide a guide in determining which leak detection method is appropriate for particular operating settings. In addition, research gaps and open issues for development of reliable pipeline leakage detection systems are discussed.},

abstract = {Oil and gas transmission pipelines require monitoring for maintenance and safety, to prevent equipment failure and accidents. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology is emerging as an opportunity to supplement current monitoring systems. Small UAV technological solutions are flexible and adaptable and with a demonstrated capacity to obtain valuable data at small to medium spatial scales. Systematic surveys of extensive areas are better completed with fixed-wing platforms and automatic flight design, whilst multirotor platforms provide flexibility in shorter and localized inspection missions. The type of sensor carried by an aerial platform determines the sort of data acquired and the obtainable information; sensors also determine the need for specific mechanical designs and the provision of energy on-board required from the system. UAV systems prototyped to monitor pipelines are reviewed in this paper, and a number of monitoring scenarios are proposed and illustrated. Notwithstanding difficulties encountered in the generalization of use for civilian applications, small UAVs have demonstrated, through research and operational cases, the capacity to support the inspection and monitoring of oil and gas pipelines.},

abstract = {With the emerging demand for road safety and entertainment applications, efficient information exchanges among vehicles in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have attracted considerable attention. Since VANETs usually suffer from intermittent connectivity, long delay, and packet loss, Road-Side Unit (RSU) placement has been introduced to improve communication performance recently. Although some researchers have focused on scheduling and routing of buses, efficient communication in public transportation systems with infrastructure has not been well studied. In this paper, we use a space-time graph to model topology changes in Bus Ad-hoc Networks (BANETs), and then propose an effective greedy algorithm to minimize the number of RSUs, such that the communication delay between any two buses is within a given delay bound in BANETs. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we conduct simulations and analyze the performance. The simulation results show that our algorithm can significantly reduce the number of installed RSUs and the average end-to-end delay in the entire network.},

We adopt the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) metric to evaluate the accuracy provided by RSU placements, and derive the expression of GDOP towards received signal strength (RSS) and hybrid parameter estimators, respectively. There are two steps contained in the proposed method. Firstly, the optimal elementary pattern is obtained and applied to form the 1-coverage placement. Secondly, the optimal K-coverage placement based on K-layer elementary patterns is found by minimizing the average GDOP of the road area, using asynchronous particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm. In simulations the convergence and stability of APSO solutions are verified, then our method is compared with existing uniform placement method, the results show that the proposed method can achieve better positioning performance.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks have become an attractive choice for many monitoring applications in an unattended setups; some of these applications such as pipeline, railroad and highways monitoring require the sensors to be placed in a linear topology. These sensors need to be placed as far apart while still maintaining a minimum required coverage in order to minimize the required node count and reduce cost. In this paper, we present three optimization models for determining the node density that varies in the objective. The first opts to achieve a desired level of detection fidelity while minimizing the number of deployed sensors. The second model considers the scenario with a constrained node count and determines the position of the available nodes such that the coverage is maximized. In the third model, we strive to minimize the number of deployed nodes when the desired fidelity is not uniform and some locations require higher coverage than others. The proposed optimization formulations are generic in nature and can be applied to any sensor coverage model. The three optimization models are validated through implementation using an attenuated disc coverage model where the detectability of a sensor is inversely proportional to the distance.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new layout optimization approach for health monitoring of locally damaged and non-piggable segments of pipelines is presented. In contrast to the existing literature, the proposed optimization-based approach considers (i) sensors network and human inspection, as detection methods, together, (ii) severity level of damages, such as damage size and risk of failure, (iii) three probabilistic detection metrics (to detect, infer, and size different damages) and a health monitoring cost metric simultaneously, (iv) several key attributes of detection methods, such as data acquisition cost and frequency, in an optimization context, and (v) probabilistic sampling methods and probabilistic damage data. An optimization model for determining decision variables such as the type and location of sensors and human inspection areas and tools along a pipeline is formulated. Due to the unavailability of publicly available real-world data and benchmarks, applications of the proposed approach are demonstrated using two notional examples with synthetically generated damage data. In the first example, a step-by-step demonstration of the proposed approach is given. Considering the severity level of different localized damages, it is shown that the proposed layout optimization approach can obtain a better and more robust solution, especially when used during a pipeline design, compared to those that only consider a single detection method or rely on deterministic damage data. In the second example, a longer pipeline segment with a greater density of localized damages is considered to show applicability of the proposed approach to larger sized problems. Finally, based on the results obtained it is demonstrated that the proposed approach provides a practical solution for consideration of probabilistic detection metrics and probabilistic damage data corresponding to stochastic degradation processes in optimal health monitoring of pipelines.},

abstract = {Leakage in oil, gas, or water pipeline networks is a global concern; its impact has serious consequences on the ecosystem. Several solutions have been either proposed or in service for monitoring the pipeline networks. These proposals, however, are expensive, time-consuming, and most are intrusive which necessitate interrupting ongoing operations. The advances in sensing technologies made it possible to build affordable non-intrusive solutions. However, building a sensor network that is able to continuously monitor the pipeline, detect, and report any anomaly poses a number of challenges: node placement, energy saving, data flow, throughput, and just to mention a few. This paper presents an adaptive clustering algorithm for grouping and deploying multiple sensors along the whole pipeline. By using this algorithm, each group of sensors selects adaptively a cluster head, which aggregates the incoming traffic from its members and then delivers it to the next cluster head and so on until it reaches the base station. The simulation and prototype-based experiments' results have shown significant energy saving compared to contemporary approaches.},

abstract = {The efficient and safe management of air conditioner (AC), Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and water pipelines in large buildings is a major challenge for the safety of these buildings. In recent years, Linear Wireless Sensor Networks (LWSN) are being used extensively for monitoring of long natural gas, water, and oil pipelines. LWSNs can also be used for efficient and safe management of AC, PNG and water pipelines in large buildings. In this paper, a scheme for optimal placement of sensors and base stations in a linear fashion to monitor the various pipelines used in large buildings has been proposed. The proposed scheme utilizes the Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA) and has been compared with three strategies, namely Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Greedy Approach with respect to throughput, lifetime and end-to-end delay. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme exhibits better performance in comparison to the other three considered techniques for all the three parameters. The most striking feature of the proposed approach is that optimization is more effective when the length of the pipeline is more as far as end-to-end delay is concerned. The lifetime of the network is significantly improved using the proposed approach, especially when the length of the pipeline is of medium size, which makes the proposed scheme suitable for energy efficient buildings.},

Linear Wireless Sensor Network (LWSN) is one of the best ways to monitor these pipelines efficiently. In LWSN, the positioning of nodes and the routing scheme can be used to avoid the losses occur during transportation of these resources to their corresponding destinations. This paper modifies the Lion Optimization Algorithm by using the lightning procedure of cloud for defining the position of sensor nodes while for routing jump and redirect routing scheme is used. In this algorithm, the lions travel from one location to the other as the light moves from cloud towards the ground. The algorithm proves its significance by showing significant improvement while comparing its performance with four existing algorithms including Lion Optimization Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization and without optimization. The performance parameters considered during simulation are delay, throughput and lifetime.},

abstract = {The wireless sensor network (WSN) technology have been evolving very quickly in recent years. Sensors are constantly increasing in sensing, processing, storage, and communication capabilities. In many WSNs that are used in environmental, commercial and military applications, the sensors are lined up linearly due to the linear nature of the structure or area that is being monitored making a special class of these networks; We defined these in a previous paper as Linear Sensor Networks (LSNs), and provided a classification of the different types of LSNs. A pure multihop approach to route the data all the way along the linear network (e.g. oil, gas and water pipeline monitoring, border monitoring, road-side monitoring, etc.), which can extend for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers can be very costly from an energy dissipation point of view. In order to significantly reduce the energy consumption used in data transmission and extend the network lifetime, we present a framework for monitoring linear infrastructures using LSNs where data collection and transmission is done using UAVs. The system defines four types of nodes, which include: sensor nodes (SNs), relay nodes (RNs), UAVs, and sinks. The SNs use a classic WSN multihop routing approach to transmit their data to the nearest RN, which acts as a cluster head for its surrounding SNs. A UAV moves back and forth along the linear network and transports the data that is collected by the RNs to the sinks located at both ends of the LSN. We name this network architecture a UAV-based LSN (ULSN). In addition, three different UAV movement approaches are presented, simulated, and analyzed in order to measure the system performance under various network conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

However, compared with other WSNs, the energy imbalance problem of long and linear WSNs is more serious, and the delay is higher. It is still impossible to achieve efficient data aggregation by optimizing the clustering structure. Therefore, this letter proposes a novel data aggregation tree based on a clustering structure. First, through the optimization of cluster head selection and multihop path selection, this letter proposes a long and linear nonuniform clustering structure to improve the energy balance. Furthermore, taking the minimum delay as the objective function and the number of fusion nodes and energy balance as the constraint, an aggregation node selection mechanism based on a swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to build a data aggregation tree based on a long and linear nonuniform clustering structure. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the delay and energy consumption and that it is suitable for long and linear WSNs.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

abstract = {Intelligent wireless networks that comprise self-organizing autonomous vehicles equipped with punctual sensors and radio modules support many hostile and harsh environment monitoring systems. This work's contribution shows the benefits of applying such networks to estimate clouds' boundaries created by hazardous toxic substances heavier than air when accidentally released into the atmosphere. The paper addresses issues concerning sensing networks' design, focussing on a computing scheme for online motion trajectory calculation and data exchange. A three-stage approach that incorporates three algorithms for sensing devices' displacement calculation in a collaborative network according to the current task, namely exploration and gas cloud detection, boundary detection and estimation, and tracking the evolving cloud, is presented. A network connectivity-maintaining virtual force mobility model is used to calculate subsequent sensor positions, and multi-hop communication is used for data exchange. The main focus is on the efficient tracking of the cloud boundary. The proposed sensing scheme is sensitive to crucial mobility model parameters. The paper presents five procedures for calculating the optimal values of these parameters. In contrast to widely used techniques, the presented approach to gas cloud monitoring does not calculate sensors' displacements based on exact values of gas concentration and concentration gradients. The sensor readings are reduced to two values: the gas concentration below or greater than the safe value. The utility and efficiency of the presented method were justified through extensive simulations, giving encouraging results. The test cases were carried out on several scenarios with regular and irregular shapes of clouds generated using a widely used box model that describes the heavy gas dispersion in the atmospheric air. The simulation results demonstrate that using only a rough measurement indicating that the threshold concentration value was exceeded can detect and efficiently track a gas cloud boundary. This makes the sensing system less sensitive to the quality of the gas concentration measurement. Thus, it can be easily used to detect real phenomena. Significant results are recommendations on selecting procedures for computing mobility model parameters while tracking clouds with different shapes and determining optimal values of these parameters in convex and nonconvex cloud boundaries.},

Thus WSNs become an expedient tool to monitor the widespread gas distribution network such as Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. Pakistan. In this paper, some routing protocols performance has been investigated for gas pipeline monitoring applications. Simulated comparison of various routing protocols for WSNs deployed over gas distribution pipeline networks can give a valuable insight into the workability of the system, its performance, and other critical design parameters. The estimated lifetime of the network, node deployment for encyclopedic operation, the impact of energy harvesting from the field, and placement of the sink node at an optimal location are the key issues in the design of the WSN for pipeline network monitoring. All these issues are studied through simulation of various protocols for WSNs based upon real geographic locations of the nodes, real-world power levels and power consumptions by various processes of the wireless sensor networks. The simulations results show that DDEEC based WSN, for monitoring an actual Gas Distribution Network with a substantial quantity of nodes, can run with about 99.9% alive nodes for a benchmark period of 10 years. It was also evident from the comparison of the simulation results that the routing protocol DDEEC based system performs 0.4 to 34% better than the system based on LEACH, SEP, DEEC, and its other variants.},

This paradigm is featured by pushing the storage and computational resources closer to the end-user on edge network. For this purpose, service providers are allowed to add resources on enriched servers at access points (APs) in networks for hosting a number of end-users tasks. However, the deployment of edge servers is still a technological challenge with respect to the end-user pricing model, resource capacity of the server, worthy server, and the management of the latency between users and the servers, etc. A careful investigation into existing methods shows that most of the existing approaches are limited in many ways: (1) they tended to consider the single service provider configuration with a single pricing model only, and (2) they tended to ignore real-time performance variations of edge resources. In this work, we present a meta-heuristic-based method for resource allocation. It overcomes the above limitations and aims to reduce the overall cost of the edge user by appropriately managing budget and deadline constraints.

The use of sensors and sensor networks can help to make an early detection in order to mitigate their effect over the medium. The deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) requires high-energy efficiency and secures mechanisms to ensure the data veracity. Moreover, when WSNs are deployed in harsh environments, it is very difficult to recharge or replace the sensor's batteries. For this reason, the increase of network lifetime is highly desired. WSNs also work in unattended environments, which is vulnerable to different sort of attacks. Therefore, both energy efficiency and security must be considered in the development of routing protocols for WSNs. In this paper, we present a novel Secure and Low-energy Zone-based Routing Protocol (SeLeZoR) where the nodes of the WSN are split into zones and each zone is separated into clusters. Each cluster is controlled by a cluster head. Firstly, the information is securely sent to the zone-head using a secret key; then, the zone-head sends the data to the base station using the secure and energy efficient mechanism.

@article{Lin2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers. This paper proposes an innovative buried wireless sensor network (B-WSN) system for detecting leakage from pipeline joints caused by large ground movements such as earthquakes. The key challenge to any such system is that electromagnetic (EM) signal strength becomes significantly attenuated over short distances when wireless devices are buried in certain materials-notably soil, this paper's focus. After simulation results indicated that the EM radio frequency was a key factor influencing the depth through which a signal can propagate in soil, the B-WSN system was developed, which includes a high-performance sub-1-GHz transceiver that utilizes a low-power band frequency at 433 MHz. Field testing indicated that the BWSN can achieve a penetration depth of 2.13 m. The system configuration includes a radio link budget of 120 dB, transmit power of 26 dBm, receive sensitivity of-125 dBm, and omnidirectional antenna gain of 1.5 dBi. The system works on multihop topology, meaning that each sensing node also acts as a relay node to assist other nodes buried deeper in the ground with data communication. For purposes of this paper, four hops were used, and this made wireless communication possible at an overall burial depth of 8 m. As such, the proposed B-WSN system would be compatible with most buried utility pipelines. The conducted full-scale pipeline-rupture experiment results further verified that the system can, in close to real time, pinpoint locations and subsequent patterns of water leakage caused by severe ground deformation. The findings also exemplify how the B-WSN system could aid structural evaluation of pipelines that are likely to experience large ground deformation. The average packet-loss rate was less than 0.1% during the experiment, and in terms of average power consumption, each sensing node used less than 26.5 mA per 30 s data-reporting period. Thus, the sensing nodes can be expected to function continuously for 27 days if powered by four standard industrial D-cell batteries, or for more than 2 years if the data-reporting period is changed to 1 h.},

abstract = {The industrial world of oil and gas involves critical processes and machinery for the exploration, extraction, refining, transporting and marketing petroleum products. Oil and gas companies need to control, monitor, maintain and secure the processes and industrial assets in an efficient manner. To resolve the critical challenges of pipeline condition, corrosion and integrity monitoring, gas leak detection, and other related problems, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) provide promising solutions. WSN is the most prevalent technology used in oil and gas industry that has provided remote facilities to detect and report the anomalous events like the positions of leakage, corrosion or any other damage. A few existing studies in the literature do not cover the recent WSN based systems and techniques and only review the pipeline monitoring systems. These surveys lack the recent WSN based systems developed for monitoring and detecting damages to pipelines as well as other assets of oil and gas industry. In this paper we present a comprehensive review and detailed comparison of the most recent systems or techniques developed for monitoring various anomalous events that are involved in the three sectors (upstream, midstream, downstream) of oil and gas industry. We also describe the important requirements of WSNs to be deployed in the oil and gas industry. Finally, we highlight critical challenges of oil and gas industry.},

abstract = {An efficient content caching policy at the edge of the mobile cellular network can improve the quality of services of the mobile users and reduces network congestion at the backhaul. On the other hand, the wireless network virtualization emerges as a cutting-edge technique to address the limited network capacity problem due to the exponential growth of the mobile data traffic. In addition, the wireless network virtualization can bring huge benefits such as reducing the capital expenditure (CAPEX) and the operational expenditure (OPEX) as well as improving the network capacity. In this regard, one of the key requirements to recognize the benefits of the above mentioned two technologies is to have an applicable resource allocation framework, that enables the deployment of the content caching schemes in the virtualized wireless network. In this study, we investigate a novel joint radio resource allocation and content caching problem to efficiently utilize the radio resource blocks, the transmit power, and the available cache storage at the base stations (BSs). The goal of the formulated problem presented in this paper focuses on minimizing the delays experienced by the end mobile users of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). We show that the formulated problem is a non-convex, mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP), which is NP-hard and simply intractable. Therefore, we deploy the block upper-bound minimization (BSUM) algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Numerical results show that our method outperforms the existing baseline resource allocation schemes, with up to 19% performance gain in terms of network delay.},

abstract = {A single-server queuing-inventory system in which arrivals are governed by a batch Markovian arrival process and successive arrival batch sizes form a finite first-order Markov chain is considered in this paper. Service is provided in batches according to a batch Markovian service process, with consecutive service batch sizes forming a finite first-order Markov chain. A service starts for the next batch on completion of the current service, provided that inventory is available at that epoch; otherwise, there will be a delay in starting the next service. When the service of a batch is completed, the inventory decreases by 1 unit, irrespective of batch size. A control policy in which the server goes on vacation when a service process is frozen until a quorum can initiate the next batch service is proposed to ensure idle-time utilization. During the vacation, the server produces inventory (items) for future services until it hits a specified level L or until the number of customers in the system reaches a maximum service batch size N, with whichever occurring first. In the former case, a server stays idle once the processed inventory level reaches L until the number of customers reaches (or even exceeds because of batch arrival) a maximum service batch size N. The time required for processing one unit of inventory follows a phase-type distribution. In this paper, the steady-state probability vector of this infinite system is computed. The distributions of inventory processing time in a vacation cycle, idle time in a vacation cycle, and vacation cycle length are found. The effect of correlation in successive inter-arrival times and service times on performance measures for such a queuing system is illustrated with a numerical example. An optimization problem is considered. The proposed system is then compared with a queuing-inventory system without the Markov-dependent assumption on successive arrivals as well as service batch sizes using numerical examples.},

abstract = {Methods of queueing theory are often used for telecommunication systems performance evaluation. According to this approach, all MAC and PHY layer protocols details are modelled with a given service time distribution, and the precision of the estimated properties depends on this distribution function selection. While for Ethernet and wireless relay networks the service time is roughly equal to the sum of packet and headers sizes divided by the channel bitrate, it is not so easy to estimate the service time for wireless networks channels based on CSMA/CA including IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) and IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) due to random exponential backoff and collisions. In this paper we use a simple model of the saturated channel described as a semi-Markov random absorbing process, which is based on Bianchi model [2]. We use this process to find a service time phase-type (PH) distribution matching the first two moments of the semi-Markov process. We also use channel simulation model to sample transmission delays in unsaturated mode and find another PH-distribution using G-FIT [12] algorithm. Then we use these PH-distributions to estimate end-to-end delays, queue sizes and nodes utilization in a multi-hop wireless network with linear topology using queueing network. All results are compared to wireless network simulation model, and demonstrate the cases in which the queueing network tends to provide results close to real network performance.},

@article{Sandmann2012,
abstract = {In almost all applications of queueing network models it is assumed that for each customer the service times at different network nodes are independent. But service times in, for instance, computer and communication networks are typically essentially determined by properties like message or packet lengths that do not change substantially on the route through the network. Therefore, the service times of any customer in a queueing network are likely to be correlated, which can significantly influence quality of service (QoS) properties and performance measures such that results obtained with the independence assumption may be misleading. We consider delays in a series of queues with correlated service times at each network node where for each customer the service time at the first node is a random variable and the successive service times are correlated with the one at the first node. A recursive scheme for delays is provided. This scheme is used in order to efficiently conduct a simulation study where two types of correlation are studied, namely identical service times, and service times with an additional Gaussian noise. The simulation study focuses on comparisons of end-to-end delays for independent service times at different nodes and correlated service times, respectively. It turns out that for both correlation types, in light traffic the delays in case of correlated service times are larger than for independent service times by a factor that first increases with increasing traffic intensity up to a maximum value approached in medium traffic after which it decreases quickly and drops down to become significantly smaller than one in heavy traffic. This effect intensifies with increasing number of network nodes and depends, as well as the crossover point from which on correlated service times yield smaller delays, on the distribution of the service times at the first node. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Some companies and experts believe that “Oil and Gas 4.0” can completely change the status quo of the oil and gas industry, which can bring huge benefits because it accelerates the digitization and intelligentization of the oil and gas industry. However, the “Oil and Gas 4.0” is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper systematically introduces the concept and core technologies of “Oil and Gas 4.0”, such as big data and the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Moreover, this paper analyzes typical application scenarios of the oil and gas industry chain (upstream, midstream and downstream) through examples, such as intelligent oilfield, intelligent pipeline, and intelligent refinery. It is concluded that the essence of “Oil and Gas 4.0” is a data-driven intelligence system based on the highly digitization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic peer-reviewed paper on the “Oil and Gas 4.0” era, aiming to let more oil and gas industry personnel understand its benefits and application scenarios, so as to better apply it to practical engineering in the future.

Knowing where to place these RSUs so that a maximum number of vehicles circulating is covered is a challenge. We model the problem as a Maximum Coverage with Time Threshold Problem (MCTTP), and use a genetic algorithm to solve it. The algorithm is tested in four real-world datasets, and compared to a greedy approach previously proposed in the literature. The results show that our approach finds better results than the greedy in all scenarios, with gains up to 11 percentage points. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a mobile and wireless network that consists of connected vehicles, and stationary nodes called roadside units (RSUs) placed on the aboard of roads to improve traffic safety and to ensure drivers' and passengers' comfort. However, deploying RSUs is one of the most important challenges in VANETs due to the involved placement, configuration, and maintenance costs in addition to the network connectivity. This study focuses on the issue of deploying a set of RSUs that is able to maximize network coverage with a reduced cost. In this paper, we propose a new formulation of RSUs deployment issue as a maximum intersection coverage problem through a graph-based modeling. Moreover, we propose a new bio-inspired RSU placement system called Ant colony optimization system for RSU deployment in VANET (AC-RDV). AC-RDV is based on the idea of placing RSUs within the more popular road intersections, which are close to popular places like touristic and commercial areas. Since RSU deployment problem is considered as NP-Hard, AC-RDV inspires by the foraging behavior of real ant colonies to discover the minimum number of RSU intersections that ensures the maximum network connectivity. After a set of simulations and comparisons against traditional RSU placement strategies, the results obtained showed the effectiveness of the proposed AC-RDV in terms of number of RSUs placed, the average area coverage, the average connectivity and the overlapping ratio.},

abstract = {Optimal road side unit (RSU) deployment is of crucial importance to vehicular ad hoc networks. The RSU deployment (RD) problem models in the literature usually lack the ability to describe curve-shaped roads and roads nonuniform statistics. We had proposed a more realistic RD problem model taking these features into consideration. However, our understanding of the RD problem with the new model is still seriously limited. In this paper, we try to deepen our understanding of the one-dimensional RD (D1RD) problem with the new model by analyzing its properties and designing optimal and efficient approximate algorithms for it. We first analyze the properties of optimal solutions of the D1RD problem. Next, suspecting that the D1RD problem with n RSUs of different coverage radii is intractable, we propose two greedy-based algorithms (named as Greedy2P3 and Greedy2P3E) and show that Greedy2P3E's approximation ratio is at least 1-(\frac{n-1}{n})^2. Then, by exploiting the properties of the D1RD problem, we propose an optimal algorithm named OptGreDyn by combining greedy idea and dynamic programming, and prove its optimality. At last, we proved that, if applied to the RD problem with n RSUs of identical radii, the approximation ratios of Greedy2P3 and Greedy2P3E are at least \frac{2}{3} , and it is tight for Greedy2P3 when n=3i , where i is a positive integer. Simulation results verify the optimality of OptGreDyn, meanwhile show that Greedy2P3 and Greedy2P3E usually return near-optimal solutions with profit more than 98% of the optimal solutions, and they are preferable than the existing approximate algorithms.},

abstract = {The success of vehicular networks is highly dependent on the coverage of messages, which refers to the trajectory of messages over time. Many of the existing works primarily performed in 1-D environments (i.e., straight highways) and/or merely focused on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to enhance the coverage in a given road network. Consequently, there still lacks a clear comprehension of using road infrastructures (e.g., roadside units), to improve the message coverage in 2-D environments (i.e., urban areas). In this paper, we study the problem of optimal utilization of roadside units in 2-D environments. Specifically, we develop a message coverage maximization algorithm (MCMA) that carefully deploys the roadside units to achieve the maximum message coverage. Considering that the vehicle density is heterogeneous across the road networks, we study the message coverage for V2V networks by deriving analytical lower bounds of message dissemination distance for areas with different vehicle densities. The MCMA then utilizes the derived lower bounds to estimate the minimum spacing allowed between neighbor roadside units based on the prevailing traffic stream and delay constraint of applications. In addition, we propose a disseminator selection algorithm for infrastructure-based urban vehicular networks to further improve the message coverage. By selecting desired types of applications (i.e., safety and non-safety), we obtain two different roadside unit deployment sets from MCMA for the evaluation purpose. Extensive simulation studies show that MCMA outperforms the alternative algorithms in terms of the message coverage and message dissemination speed. The results also demonstrate that MCMA improves traffic efficiency in a post-crash scenario.},

However, real-world deployment and network optimization require accurate path-loss (PL) modeling, so as to estimate network coverage, performance, and profitability. For that reason, in this paper, LoRaWAN radio channel is investigated in the 868 MHz band. Extensive measurement campaigns were carried out in both indoor and outdoor environments at urban and rural locations in Lebanon (Saint Joseph University of Beirut campus, Beirut city, and Bekaa valley). Based on empirical results, PL models are developed for LoRaWAN communications and compared with widely used empirical models. Moreover, the performance and the coverage of LoRaWAN deployment are evaluated based on real measurements. The results show that the proposed PL models are accurate and simple to be applied in Lebanon and other similar locations. Coverage ranges up to 8 and 45 km were obtained in urban and rural areas, respectively. This reveals the reliability of this promising technology for long-range IoT communications.},

The improved model can define various types of walls with different attenuation characteristics.

The effects of the number of the walls to be traversed along the radio propagation path are considered in the model. To propose the model, the previous works on well-known indoor path loss models are discussed. Then, the path loss produced by the intervening walls in the propagation path is measured, and the terms representing the loss factors in the theoretical path-loss model are modified. The analyzed results of the path loss factors acquired at 2.45 GHz are presented.

In this paper, we study the problem of joint transmission scheduling and channel allocation aiming to minimize the end-to-end delay of multiple flows in multihop WirelessHART networks. We propose a new network model based on a multidimensional scheduling space spanned by flow-link-channel-slot tuples. A multidimensional conflict graph is then established to depict the conflict relationships among the tuples. Based on this, the original delay minimization problem is formulated as an integer program, which however is difficult to solve due to its significantly large scale. To this end, we develop an iterative hop-wise scheduling algorithm by transforming the original problem into a series of maximum weighted independent set problems. We derive theoretical analysis on the schedulability and the performance bound of the proposed algorithm. In addition, we show that our results can be easily extended to accommodate more general scenarios.

This standard relies on techniques such as channel hopping and bandwidth reservation to ensure both energy savings and reliable transmissions. Since many applications require low end-to-end delay (e.g. alarms), we propose here a distributed algorithm to schedule the transmissions with a short end-to-end delay. We divide the network in stratums, regrouping all the nodes with the same depth in the DODAG constructed by RPL. Then, different time-frequency blocks are assigned deterministically to each stratum. By appropriately organizing the blocks in the slotframe, we are able to deliver a packet before the end of the slotframe, whatever the route length is. We present a simple analytical study to define the initial size of each block in a homogeneous scenario. We experimentally analyze the behavior of our strategy to validate its ability to provide both high reliability and low latency in a distributed manner.},

abstract = {The problem of transmission scheduling in single hop and multi-hop wireless networks has been extensively studied. The focus has been on optimizing the efficiency of transmission parallelization, through a minimum-length schedule that meets a given set of traffic demands using the smallest possible number of time slots. Each time slot is associated with a set of transmissions that are compatible with each other according to the considered interference model. The minimum-length approach maximizes the resource reuse, but it does not ensure minimum end-to-end packet delay for multiple source-destination pairs, due to its inherent assumption of frame periodicity. In the paper we study the problem of transmission scheduling and routing aiming at minimizing the end-to-end delay under the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) model for multi-hop networks. Two schemes are investigated. The first scheme departs from the conventional scheduling approach, by addressing explicitly end-to-end delay and removing the restriction of frame periodicity. The second scheme extends the first one by featuring cooperative forwarding and forward interference cancellation. We study the properties of the two schemes, and propose novel mixed-integer programming models and solution algorithms.

abstract = {Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) require data to be communicated timely and reliably. However, radio transmission errors incurred by wireless channel make it difficult to achieve these qualities simultaneously. To provide good quality of service (QoS) of WMSNs, parameters associated with the WMSNs need to be studied completely and best tradeoff needs to be made. To characterize the delay-reliability tradeoff, first, our goal is to evaluate the performance measures of the system, such as end-To-end delay and reliability in different situations and against different choices of system parameters (e.g., data rate, number of hops). Second, we characterize how the end-To-end delay and reliability affect the performance of the wireless multimedia sensor networks under indoor and outdoor environments. All scenarios are simulated with multiple runtimes by using NS-2 simulator and the results are evaluated and discussed.},

Using the derived probability distribution, the probability that the end-to-end delay is lower than a given threshold may be calculated. In addition, one can straightforwardly study the impact of parameters such as wireless communication range, vehicular densities, distance between source the destination, and minimum and maximum vehicle speeds on the end-to-end delay. This can help to better understand data dissemination in VANETs. Moreover, closed forms for lower and upper bounds on the end-to-end delay probability distribution are obtained. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis.},

As a result, many devices, machines, and applications will rely on connectivity, while having different requirements to the network, ranging from high reliability and low latency to high data rates. Furthermore, these industrial networks will be highly heterogeneous, as they will feature a number of diverse communication technologies. Current technologies are not well suited for this scenario, which requires that the network is managed at an abstraction level, which is decoupled from the underlying technologies. In this paper, we consider network slicing as a mechanism to handle these challenges. We present methods for slicing deterministic and packet-switched industrial communication protocols, which simplify the manageability of heterogeneous networks with various application requirements. Furthermore, we show how to use network calculus to assess the end-to-end properties of the network slices.},

In this paper, we develop a simple and accurate enough analytical model for predicting the queueing delay of real-time multimedia traffic flows in non-homogeneous random access based WLANs. This leads to tractable analysis for meeting queueing delay specifications of a number of flows. In particular, we address the feasibility problem of whether the mean delays required by a set of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows supporting real-time multimedia traffic can be guaranteed in WLANs. Based on the model and feasibility analysis, we further develop an optimization technique to minimize the delays for the traffic flows. Moreover, we present a decentralized algorithm and report its implementation and present extensive simulation and experimental trace-based results to demonstrate the accuracy of our model and the performance of the algorithms.},

The progress in these areas is due to the advances in the emerging areas such as Big data, cloud computing, fog computing and wireless networks. The advancement in these areas has paved the way for new industrial evolution, Industry 4.0 or smart factory or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IIoT is made up of a collection of devices, with each device being able to monitor, collect, exchange, analyze and take decisions intelligently based on the environment through proper communication channels. IIoT consists of smart solutions in the fields of electricity (smart-grid), home automation (smart-home), supply-chains (smart-automation) and agriculture (smart-agriculture). The interconnection among the different smart components of IIoT is a key requirement for IIoT systems. We revised all the patents relating to industry 4.0 and its application in Internet of Services (IoS). Methods: In this paper, a novel three-layered architecture is proposed to handle the heterogeneity of components of IIoT, thus providing a way for the digital transformation of IIoT systems. Results: The paper also provides an overview of underlying components, principles, communication standards and enabling technologies for IIoT or smart factory. There is no patent information used in the paper for discussing the framework. Conclusion: Recent technologies such as cloud computing, fog computing, and big data are the key enablers for IIoT systems and are transforming the way in which the industrial systems work and operate.},

abstract = {With the fast-paced realization of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, completely centralized networking solutions will no longer be sufficient to meet the stringent requirements of the related industrial applications. Besides requiring fast response time and increased reliability, they will necessitate computational resources at the edge of the network, which demands advanced communication and data management techniques. In this paper, we provide an overview of the network communications and data management aspects for the Industry 4.0. Our global perspective is to understand the key communication and data management challenges and peculiarities for the effective realization of the fourth industrial revolution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes hybrid communications management and decentralized data distribution solutions supported by a hierarchical and multi-tier network architecture. The proposed solutions combine local and decentralized management with centralized decisions to efficiently use the available network resources and meet the requirements of Industry 4.0 applications. To this end, the distributed management entities interact in order to coordinate their decisions and ensure the correct operation of the whole network. Finally, the use of Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing is proposed to achieve the required flexibility to efficiently meet the stringent and varying communication and data management requirements of industrial applications.},

In mobile communication the accuracy prediction of path losses is a crucial element during network planning and optimization. However, the existence of multiple propagation models means that there is no propagation model which is precisely and accurate in prediction of path loss fit for every environs other than in which they were designed. This paper presents few empirical models suitable for path loss prediction in mobile communication. Experimental measurements of received power for the 900 MHz GSM system are made in urban, suburban, and rural areas of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Measured data are compared with those obtained by five prediction models: Stanford University Interim (SUI) models [1], the COST-231 Hata model [2], the ECC-33 model [3], the ERICSSON model [4], and the HATA-OKUMURA model [5]. The results show that in general the SUI, COST-231, ERICSSON, and Hata-Okumura under-predict the path loss in all environments, while the ECC-33 model shows the best results, especially in suburban and over-predict pathloss in urban area.},

Though using UAVs on such missions is not a new phenomenon anymore, forming them into autonomous groups (called swarms) to accomplish the missions more efficiently is still a hot topic. To implement smart algorithms efficiently in UAV swarms, it is crucial to consider device capabilities, networking technologies, and environmental conditions. A wireless channel model involving path loss is a fundamental element of designing efficient networking schemes for swarms. This paper presents the adoption of known channel models to air-to-air UAV communication scenarios and discusses the results of an exemplary simulation that reckons a swarm of multi-copter UAVs flying over rugged terrains.

However, SUI outperforms Ericsson and Empirical Hata for 3.5 GHz for both urban and suburban environments. For higher frequencies (28 GHz), which is needed for the new generation of mobile networks like 5G, it is shown that Ericsson model gives better results for path loss in urban compared with SUI which gives better results in suburban environment.

It adds that, in some coastal areas, the geometry of the reflection changes over time due to tides. When choosing an antenna height for an inshore node, often the largest possible height is used, but this approach can lead to signal degradation. The two-ray model is the most fundamental path loss model to account for the contribution of the reflected ray. We carried out experimental measurements at the shores of a freshwater body to verify that the two-ray model can predict the major trends of the path loss experienced by a 2.4 GHz over-water wireless link. We focus on short-to-medium distance links, with antennas installed a few meters above surface. We observed considerable consistency between measurements and model estimates, leading us to conclude that the two-ray model may bring benefits when applied to the network design of over-water links affected by tidal variations, which is our end-goal.},

We then demonstrate that the two-ray ground-reflection model can be observed within many vehicular scenarios and fit ray-tracing data with the two-ray model. Finally we devise a measurement strategy as well as the usage of an ℓ1 algorithm for piecewise linear fitting slopes to the model data.

The correct modeling of propagation and path loss is of paramount importance in wireless sensor network (WSN) system design and analysis [1]. Most of the important performance metrics commonly employed for WSNs, such as energy dissipation, route optimization, reliability, and connectivity, are affected by the utilized propagation model. However, in many studies on WSNs, overly simplistic and unrealistic propagation models are used. One of the reasons for the utilization of such impractical propagation models is the lack of awareness of experimentally available WSN-specific propagation and path-loss models. In this article, necessary succint background information is given on general wireless propagation modeling, and salient WSN-specific constraints on path-loss modeling are summarized. Building upon the provided background, an overview of the experimentally verified propagation models for WSNs is presented, and quantitative comparisons of propagation models employed in WSN research under various scenarios and frequency bands are provided.},

abstract = {Recently, large-scale wireless seismometer array (WSA) have played an increasingly important role in oil/gas exploration industry and seismology research. However, due to limited wireless channel bandwidth, transmission latency and high power consumption caused by transmission conflicts in battery- powered seismometers, real-time large-scale WSA system remains unsolved. In this article, we introduce a LoRaWAN-based WSA system with high precise time slot deriving from a synchronization platform composed of GPS timing module and temperature compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) clock counter. Using the global sharing time slot, we propose an Equal Air Time and CuckooHash (EAT&CH) algorithm for the WSA to resolve channel congestion and delays when multiple seismometers upload data simultaneously. In EAT&CH, an equal air-time spreading factor (SF) allocation method based on the coarse/fine-grained theory is employed to reduce the collision probability of data transmission. To improve the scalability of the WSA in terms of reducing both collision probability and data delay, a different carrier frequency (CF) channel with the same SF allocation plan depending on CuckooHash is designed to reduce the network latency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves nearly 100% data extraction rate of the WSA with less than two times the delay, compared with the existing Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism.},

abstract = {Tandem queueing systems often arise in wireless networks modeling. Queueing models are very suitable for network performance evaluation but the system complexity exponential growth (or state space explosion) could make the analysis barely feasible. The paper presents a comparative study of various methods of a state space reduction for markovian arrival processes (MAP) and phase-type distributions (PH) applied to tandem queueing systems. The applied methods include nonlinear optimization, EM-algorithm and linear minimization. While most of the described algorithms are well-studied, a number of issues arises when applying them to a tandem system of a real wireless network. Particularly, it is shown that while all the algorithms could be applied to tandems with a small number of queues, bigger tandems require additional effort to get the appropriable results. Nevertheless, the results presented show that the departure MAPs reduction may help to solve the state space explosion problem.},

In this paper, we study a probabilistically preemptive bufferless M/PH/1/1 queue fed with information update packets from N separate information sources for which a new information packet arrival from source-m is allowed to preempt a packet from source-n in service, with a probability depending on n and m. To make the model even more general than the existing ones, we assume a distinct phase-type (PH-type) service time distribution, a distinct packet error and retransmission probability, for each of the information sources. Using sample path arguments and the theory of Markov Fluid Queues (MFQ), the exact distributions of the AoI and PAoI are numerically obtained for each of the sources. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the impact of various system parameters on AoI performance. In the context of a two-source system, we present a methodology on how to optimally choose the preemption probabilities and packet generation rates so as to minimize certain AoI-oriented cost functions.},

We assume that the state of the server is governed by an alternating Markov renewal process. For this queue, we analyze various performance measures in steady state. Most of the previous studies on the analysis of delayed mobile data offloading assume that service times, ON- and OFF-period lengths, and impatience times are exponentially distributed, and the effect of their distributions on the queueing performance has not been investigated well. We thus discuss the effects of the variability in the service time distribution, the variability in the ON-period distribution, and the correlation between the ON- and OFF-periods, and we show that those factors, especially the variability in service times, has a great impact on the queueing performance. Furthermore, to demonstrate the modeling capability of Markov-renewal service interruptions, we illustrate such models as the mobility of smartphone users in a two-dimensional area is incorporated, and we show how the queueing performance is affected by the geographical distribution of Wi-Fi access points.},

In this paper we present and evaluate four MIP formulations for the classical job shop scheduling problem (JSP). While MIP formulations for the JSP have existed since the 1960s, it appears that comprehensive computational studies have not been performed since then. Due to substantial improvements in MIP technology in recent years, it is of interest to compare the standard JSP models using modern optimization software. We perform a fully crossed empirical study of four MIP models using CPLEX, GUROBI and SCIP, focusing on both the number of instances that can be proved optimal and the solution quality over time. Our results demonstrate that modern MIP solvers are able to prove optimality for moderate-sized problems very quickly. Comparing the four MIP models, the disjunctive formulation proposed by Manne performs best on both performance measures. We also investigate the performance of MIP with multi-threading and parameter tuning using CPLEX. Noticeable performance gain is observed when compared to the results using only single thread and default parameter settings. Our results serve as a snapshot of the performance of modern MIP solvers for an important, well-studied scheduling problem. Finally, the results of MIP is compared to constraint programming (CP), another common approach for scheduling, and the best known complete algorithm to provide a broad view among different approaches.},

For many applications of dynamic trees, values must be combined along paths. For other applications, values must be combined over entire trees. For the latter situation, an idea used originally in parallel graph algorithms, to represent trees by Euler tours, leads to a simple implementation with a time of O(log n) per tree operation, where n is the number of tree vertices. We apply this representation to the implementation of two versions of the network simplex algorithm, resulting in a time of O(log n) per pivot, where n is the number of vertices in the problem network. {\textcopyright} 1997 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.

The network simplex algorithm is a fast and frequently used method for solving minimum-cost flow problems. However, the conventional sequential algorithms cannot satisfy the requirement of high-computational efficiency for large-scale networks. Parallel computing has resulted in numerous significant advances in science and technology over the past decades and is potential to develop an effective means to solve the computational bottleneck problem of large-scale networks. This paper first analyzes the parallelizability of network simplex algorithm and then presents a multi-granularity parallel network simplex algorithm (MPNSA) with fine- and coarse-granularity parallel strategies, which are suitable for shared- and distributed-memory parallel applications, respectively. MPNSA is achieved by message-passing interface, open multiprocessing, and compute unified device architecture, so that it can be compatible with different high-performance computing platforms. Experimental results demonstrated that MPNSA has very great accelerating effects and the maximum speedup reaches 18.7.},

We prove optimality criteria and combine two methods that are commonly used to avoid cycling in traditional network simplex algorithms into new techniques that are applicable to our problem. With these techniques and our definition of the reduced costs, we are able to prove a pseudo-polynomial running time of the overall procedure, which can be further improved by incorporating Dantzig's pivoting rule.

abstract = {3GPP has been engaged in further advancing the evolved E-UTRAN and UTRAN based radio access network technologies. NR is the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) endeavor for outlining and standardization of 5G advanced radio access technology. 3GPP has released the first set of 5G NR standards, that is, the non-standalone 5G radio specifications. As LTE technology is massively deployed and broadly accepted, the transition from LTE to 5G is very critical, and it is of maximum importance that the backward compatibility of 5G with LTE is considered. 3GPP has identified several architecture options for 5G. This article gives an overview of the NR architecture options, their deployment scenarios, and the key migration paths. LTE-NR dual connectivity (DC) is presented. This DC scenario is unique in the sense that DC is being endowed for two different generations of 3GPP radio access technologies. We further present the integration of MPTCP with LTE-NR DC and DC-like aggregation, that is, 3GPP-non-3GPP interworking to bring in the advantages of MPTCP in terms of link robustness, reliability and dynamic mapping between the traffic flows and the available paths. Finally, we discuss future research and standardization directions of the next-generation networks.},

abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) mobile network is standardized and developed to explore the mobile market beyond 2020. In response to the diverse strategies of 5G deployment, five alternative network architectures have been proposed to 3GPP by different mobile operators. To fulfill the urgent deployment requirement from some operators, an early drop of 5G, termed as non-standalone (NSA) new radio (NR), was completed at the end of 2017. After that, the standardization of a new 5G system, including th standalone (SA) new radio access network, was finished in June 2018. This article analyzes and compares the SA NR and NSA NR deployment modes in terms of coverage, network capability, interworking between 4G and 5G, complexity and cost of network deployment, and the latest industry progress. NSA NR performs better in interworking performance in the initial phase, while SA NR performs better in network capabilities, device performance, simple network deployment, and cost efficiency. 5G SA NR is recommended for operators who have the ambition to explore new opportunities in the vertical and enterprise markets.},

@article{Cicek2019,
abstract = {In this study, we consider the 3D location problem of multiple Drone Base Stations (DBSs) together with the allocation of the resources to serve the users in a wireless communication network. The problem is formulated as a dynamic capacitated single-source location-allocation problem. The capacity of a DBS is a non-linear function of the distance and the amount of resource received from terrestrial base stations. Furthermore, data rate, which is the service level, is a non-linear function of both the distance and the amount of the allocated resource. As a consequence, the optimization model is formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP), which has a higher complexity compared to many existing problems in the literature. We propose a novel heuristic algorithm for the efficient solution of the problem. The performance of the proposed heuristic is evaluated through an extensive computational study where the MINLP formulation is solved by the BARON solver. Computational results show that the proposed heuristic yields promising performance in terms of both CPU efficiency and solution accuracy. We also provide managerial insights about integrating DBSs into communication networks.},

This article discusses a scenario with events in remote areas. It is expected that the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with the directional antennas will become one of the key components of these networks and provide the solution. It attracts considerable attention in basic and applied research and commerce for its rapid deployment and flexible extension of the users coverage, mobility of UAV access points (APs) and a higher probability of line-of-sight channels. However, it also creates new issues to be addressed. The critical task is to maximize coverage area with the required quality of service to provide the connection for the maximum number of users. At the same time, analysis of the performance indicators of such networks, taking into account the mobility of both access points and users, is challenging. One of the key quality indicators is the probability of coverage. The aim of this work is to consider two drones' mobility models to cover users with small cells, and to solve the problem of maximizing coverage probability using the simulation. With a given threshold signal-to-noise ratio, it is shown that using the particle swarm method as an adaptive navigation algorithm allows achieving higher coverage probability values as opposed to k-means algorithm. A comparative analysis of adaptive navigation is presented.},

abstract = {The advantages and disadvantages of existing tools for calculating passenger flow are shown using the example of the city of Moscow.The objective of the research was to assess possibilities of using Wi-Fi data as a tool for analysing passenger flow. The authors used two types of Wi-Fi scanners and a tool they developed to analyse the collected data. The primary results of the study demonstrate the possibility of practical application of Wi-Fi data to analyse passenger flow.The described empirical studies, particularly data received from the portable Wi-Fi scanner, have shown that more than 20% of mobile devices in urban public transport and metro are used with Wi-Fi enabled, which is clearly not enough to get results necessary for comprehensive and detailed analysis of passenger flows. Nevertheless, the accumulating data allow to get possibility to forecast general passenger flow.A portable Wi-Fi scanner does not provide an opportunity to extensively capture a large area of the surveyed territory in real time (stops of urban public transport, locations where passengers enter the metro, etc.). Stationary Wi-Fi scanners could increase the amount of data and, accordingly, significantly adjust the results obtained. This enhancement could also be achieved through expansion of adoption of the tool of studying passenger flow to urban railways, i.e., in case of Moscow, to Moscow Central Circle and Moscow Central Diameters, as those routes provide Wi-Fi access at stations and in coaches.Data collected from Wi-Fi scanners can be an additional tool to other data sources, such as validation, automatic systems of passenger flow monitoring, and data obtained from cellular operators. For this reason, the further research in the field of Wi-Fi analytics along with development of technology in the field of existing data sources of passenger flow monitoring may result in better calculation of passenger flow.},

abstract = {The paper describes a wideband dual-polarized MIMO antenna designed for 5 GHz Wi-Fi communication networks. The antenna consists of two orthogonally linearly polarized 4x4 planar arrays with dipole-like radiating elements providing enhanced bandwidth. Apertures of the two arrays are overlapped by disposal of the corresponding PCBs one above the other that makes the MIMO antenna as compact as a single-polarized one. The antenna is integrated into a water-proofed enclosure with a plastic radome and has two output N-type connectors. Measurement results confirm good impedance matching (reflection coefficient is less than -10 dB) and high cross-polarization isolation of more than 23 dB in the 4.9-6.0 GHz frequency range with 17.5-18.5 dBi gain level. The beamwidth of the antenna is 17-20 deg. in both azimuth and elevation planes. High antenna gain provides increased communication distance (up to several kilometers) of the radios typically needed for any outdoor fixed wireless access applications while the antenna has been primarily developed for trackside communication networks in subways. Thus, it is already used in Moscow metro to provide high-throughput Internet access to passengers.},

However, in deep urban environments, sensitivity to blockages creates the need for more sophisticated network planning. In this paper, we present an agile strategy for deploying road-side nodes in a dense city scenario. In our system model, we consider strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints (e.g. high throughput, low latency) that are typical of ITS applications. Our approach is scalable, insofar that takes into account the unique road and building shapes of each city, performing well for both regular and irregular city layouts. It allows us not only to achieve the required QoS constraints but it also provides up to 50\% reduction in the number of nodes required, compared to existing deployment solutions.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has grown much faster. Many different devices are connected to the Internet through various network interfaces. Thus, these such devices create the heterogeneous networks and the edge heterogeneous gateways provide communication between them and cloud servers. In this article, we consider the functional framework of the edge gateway and evaluate the efficiency of using it to minimize the IoT system delay. The simulation results show that the system delay is reduced when using edge gateways.},
