abstract = {A backbone network of road side units (RSUs) is an essential part of modern intelligent transportation systems, where the roadside units are used to collect and distribute information among the mobile users. Connecting each RSU to the data center or Internet is not always feasible due to location and cost constraints. When the RSUs are located close enough to each other, they can be connected via a multihop wireless network where they play a role of the wireless routers. In this paper we consider a partial case when the roadside units are connected in a wireless network with linear topology. Each RSU is equipped with IEEE 802.11 access point that is used by the mobile users to send their data via the network, and with a relay equipment that allows the RSU to connect to the neighbouring RSUs. Each station type is defined by the coverage radius of the access point, connection distance of the relay links and the station price. We also assume that the road has several possible discrete locations where the stations can be deployed. The problem is to find out which stations should be deployed to maximize the overall coverage while providing the given solution cost. First, we formulate the problem in combinatorial form and use this formulation to prove NP-hardness of the problem. Then we define an integer linear program that can be used to find the optimal solution using a well-known software like GLPK or CPLEX.},

abstract = {Tandem queues with finite buffer capacity commonly exist in practical applications. By viewing a tandem queue as an integrated system, an innovative approach has been developed to analyze its performance through insight from Friedman's reduction method. In our approach, the starvation at the bottleneck caused by service time randomness is modeled by interruptions. Fundamental properties of tandem queues with finite buffer capacity are examined. Without the assumptions of phase-type distributions and stochastic independence, we show that, in general, the system service rate of a tandem queue with a finite buffer capacity is equal to or smaller than its bottleneck service rate, and virtual interruptions, which are the extra idle period at the bottleneck caused by the non-bottlenecks, depend on arrival rates. Hence, the system service rate is a function of arrival rates when the buffer capacity of a tandem queue is finite. Approximations for the mean queue time of a dual tandem queue are developed using the concept of virtual interruptions.},

@article{Bendel2018,
abstract = {We consider a tandem network of queues with a Poisson arrival process to the first queue. Service times are assumed to be exponential. In cases where they are not, we additionally assume a processor sharing service discipline in all servers. Consecutive servers may cooperate by pooling resources which leads to the formation of a single combined server that satisfies the aggregated service demands with a greater service rate. On this basis we define a cooperative game with transferable utility, where the cost of a coalition is the steady-state mean total number of customers in the system formed by its members. We show that the game is subadditive, leading to full cooperation being socially optimal. We then show the non-emptiness of the core, despite the characteristic function being neither monotone, nor concave. Finally, we derive several well-known solution concepts, including the Shapley value, the Banzhaf, value and the nucleolus, for the case where servers have equal mean service demands. In particular, we show that all three values coincide in this case.},

RSUs have a critical role in safety applications but also in infotainment applications. Hence, spreading RSUs should pay attention to cover with its best effort the dark zones and to serve the biggest number of vehicles with continuous services while remaining in the range of the deployment budget. To reach our objectives, we consider stationary and mobility-based statistics to model our traffic network as a graph with weighted links showing the importance of each link in terms of amount of vehicles, hazardous level, and mobility-based parameters such as average of connected time based on speed information. Then, all the potential positions are designated and two different algorithms, Knapsack and PageRank, are applied to select the optimal set of RSU positions within the cost range. Finally the output set of each algorithm is evaluated against real traffic records and statistics to show the network performance.},

Contrary to conventional wisdom, our results show that significant benefits of RSUs in terms of connectivity and message dissemination can only be achieved when the deployed RSUs are interconnected.

@article{Chattopadhyay2018,
abstract = {In this paper, we develop Gibbs sampling-based techniques for learning the optimal placement of contents in a cellular network. We consider the situation where a finite collection of base stations are scattered on the plane, each covering a cell (possibly overlapping with other cells). Mobile users request downloads from a finite set of contents according to some popularity distribution which may be known or unknown to the base stations. Each base station has a fixed memory space that can store only a strict subset of the contents at a time; hence, if a user requests content that is not stored at any of its serving base stations, the content has to be downloaded from the backhaul. Hence, we consider the problem of optimal content placement which minimizes the rate of download from the backhaul, or equivalently maximize the cache hit rate. It is known that, when multiple cells can overlap with one another (e.g., under dense deployment of base stations in small cell networks), it is not optimal to place the most popular contents in each base station. However, the optimal content placement problem is NP-complete. Using the ideas of Gibbs sampling, we propose simple sequential content update rules that decide whether to store content at a base station (if required from the base station) and which content has to be removed from the corresponding cache, based on the knowledge of contents stored in its neighboring base stations. The update rule is shown to be asymptotically converging to the optimal content placement for all nodes under the knowledge of content popularity. Next, we extend the algorithm to address the situation where content popularities and cell topology are initially unknown, but are estimated as new requests arrive to the base stations; we show that our algorithm working with the running estimates of content popularities and cell topology also converges asymptotically to the optimal content placement. Finally, we demonstrate the improvement in cache hit rate compared with the most popular content placement and independent content placement strategies via numerical exploration.},

The structures of the pipelines are designed to withstand several environmental loading conditions to ensure safe and reliable distribution from point of production to the shore or distribution depot. However, leaks in pipeline networks are one of the major causes of innumerable losses in pipeline operators and nature. Incidents of pipeline failure can result in serious ecological disasters, human casualties and financial loss. In order to avoid such menace and maintain safe and reliable pipeline infrastructure, substantial research efforts have been devoted to implementing pipeline leak detection and localisation using different approaches. This paper discusses pipeline leakage detection technologies and summarises the state-of-the-art achievements. Different leakage detection and localisation in pipeline systems are reviewed and their strengths and weaknesses are highlighted. Comparative performance analysis is performed to provide a guide in determining which leak detection method is appropriate for particular operating settings. In addition, research gaps and open issues for development of reliable pipeline leakage detection systems are discussed.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Intelligent wireless networks that comprise self-organizing autonomous vehicles equipped with punctual sensors and radio modules support many hostile and harsh environment monitoring systems. This work's contribution shows the benefits of applying such networks to estimate clouds' boundaries created by hazardous toxic substances heavier than air when accidentally released into the atmosphere. The paper addresses issues concerning sensing networks' design, focussing on a computing scheme for online motion trajectory calculation and data exchange. A three-stage approach that incorporates three algorithms for sensing devices' displacement calculation in a collaborative network according to the current task, namely exploration and gas cloud detection, boundary detection and estimation, and tracking the evolving cloud, is presented. A network connectivity-maintaining virtual force mobility model is used to calculate subsequent sensor positions, and multi-hop communication is used for data exchange. The main focus is on the efficient tracking of the cloud boundary. The proposed sensing scheme is sensitive to crucial mobility model parameters. The paper presents five procedures for calculating the optimal values of these parameters. In contrast to widely used techniques, the presented approach to gas cloud monitoring does not calculate sensors' displacements based on exact values of gas concentration and concentration gradients. The sensor readings are reduced to two values: the gas concentration below or greater than the safe value. The utility and efficiency of the presented method were justified through extensive simulations, giving encouraging results. The test cases were carried out on several scenarios with regular and irregular shapes of clouds generated using a widely used box model that describes the heavy gas dispersion in the atmospheric air. The simulation results demonstrate that using only a rough measurement indicating that the threshold concentration value was exceeded can detect and efficiently track a gas cloud boundary. This makes the sensing system less sensitive to the quality of the gas concentration measurement. Thus, it can be easily used to detect real phenomena. Significant results are recommendations on selecting procedures for computing mobility model parameters while tracking clouds with different shapes and determining optimal values of these parameters in convex and nonconvex cloud boundaries.},

abstract = {The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) usually consist of several wirelessly connected sensors, to accumulate the data from some geographically scattered field and communicate it to a central database. Thus WSNs become an expedient tool to monitor the widespread gas distribution network such as Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. Pakistan. In this paper, some routing protocols performance has been investigated for gas pipeline monitoring applications. Simulated comparison of various routing protocols for WSNs deployed over gas distribution pipeline networks can give a valuable insight into the workability of the system, its performance, and other critical design parameters. The estimated lifetime of the network, node deployment for encyclopedic operation, the impact of energy harvesting from the field, and placement of the sink node at an optimal location are the key issues in the design of the WSN for pipeline network monitoring. All these issues are studied through simulation of various protocols for WSNs based upon real geographic locations of the nodes, real-world power levels and power consumptions by various processes of the wireless sensor networks. The simulations results show that DDEEC based WSN, for monitoring an actual Gas Distribution Network with a substantial quantity of nodes, can run with about 99.9% alive nodes for a benchmark period of 10 years.

abstract = {The edge computing paradigm has experienced quick development in recent years. This paradigm is featured by pushing the storage and computational resources closer to the end-user on edge network. For this purpose, service providers are allowed to add resources on enriched servers at access points (APs) in networks for hosting a number of end-users tasks. However, the deployment of edge servers is still a technological challenge with respect to the end-user pricing model, resource capacity of the server, worthy server, and the management of the latency between users and the servers, etc. A careful investigation into existing methods shows that most of the existing approaches are limited in many ways: (1) they tended to consider the single service provider configuration with a single pricing model only, and (2) they tended to ignore real-time performance variations of edge resources. In this work, we present a meta-heuristic-based method for resource allocation. It overcomes the above limitations and aims to reduce the overall cost of the edge user by appropriately managing budget and deadline constraints. We performed extensive case studies based on real-world commercial edge computing infrastructures and multiple data Workflow templates. Experimental results clearly show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art ones.},

abstract = {Sensor networks can be used in many sorts of environments. The increase of pollution and carbon footprint are nowadays an important environmental problem. The use of sensors and sensor networks can help to make an early detection in order to mitigate their effect over the medium. The deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) requires high-energy efficiency and secures mechanisms to ensure the data veracity. Moreover, when WSNs are deployed in harsh environments, it is very difficult to recharge or replace the sensor's batteries. For this reason, the increase of network lifetime is highly desired. WSNs also work in unattended environments, which is vulnerable to different sort of attacks. Therefore, both energy efficiency and security must be considered in the development of routing protocols for WSNs. In this paper, we present a novel Secure and Low-energy Zone-based Routing Protocol (SeLeZoR) where the nodes of the WSN are split into zones and each zone is separated into clusters. Each cluster is controlled by a cluster head. Firstly, the information is securely sent to the zone-head using a secret key; then, the zone-head sends the data to the base station using the secure and energy efficient mechanism. This paper demonstrates that SeLeZoR achieves better energy efficiency and security levels than existing routing protocols for WSNs. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The Linear sensor networks have gained much attraction of the researchers due to their several positive aspects including easy deployment for linear structures and robustness in different environments. The details about the LSN models and routing techniques are mostly overlooked in the previous studies. This study, therefore, explores the concept of LSNs models and routing techniques in various types of applications. Besides, it highlights the LSN design, classification, challenges and issues as well. The core motivation for this study is to summarize the types of LSNs and analyze their routing parameters i.e. energy efficiency, reliability, route discovery, route maintenance, coverage, delay, heterogeneity and mobility of sensors. Moreover, recent LSN techniques are classified according to the similarities of routing procedures. Further, this study has investigated and discussed various proposed solutions, future directions and opportunities that would serve as a milestone for other researchers so that they could explore further the LSN routing techniques more deeply.},

@article{Lin2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers. This paper proposes an innovative buried wireless sensor network (B-WSN) system for detecting leakage from pipeline joints caused by large ground movements such as earthquakes. The key challenge to any such system is that electromagnetic (EM) signal strength becomes significantly attenuated over short distances when wireless devices are buried in certain materials-notably soil, this paper's focus. After simulation results indicated that the EM radio frequency was a key factor influencing the depth through which a signal can propagate in soil, the B-WSN system was developed, which includes a high-performance sub-1-GHz transceiver that utilizes a low-power band frequency at 433 MHz. Field testing indicated that the BWSN can achieve a penetration depth of 2.13 m. The system configuration includes a radio link budget of 120 dB, transmit power of 26 dBm, receive sensitivity of-125 dBm, and omnidirectional antenna gain of 1.5 dBi. The system works on multihop topology, meaning that each sensing node also acts as a relay node to assist other nodes buried deeper in the ground with data communication. For purposes of this paper, four hops were used, and this made wireless communication possible at an overall burial depth of 8 m. As such, the proposed B-WSN system would be compatible with most buried utility pipelines. The conducted full-scale pipeline-rupture experiment results further verified that the system can, in close to real time, pinpoint locations and subsequent patterns of water leakage caused by severe ground deformation. The findings also exemplify how the B-WSN system could aid structural evaluation of pipelines that are likely to experience large ground deformation. The average packet-loss rate was less than 0.1% during the experiment, and in terms of average power consumption, each sensing node used less than 26.5 mA per 30 s data-reporting period. Thus, the sensing nodes can be expected to function continuously for 27 days if powered by four standard industrial D-cell batteries, or for more than 2 years if the data-reporting period is changed to 1 h.},

abstract = {An efficient content caching policy at the edge of the mobile cellular network can improve the quality of services of the mobile users and reduces network congestion at the backhaul. On the other hand, the wireless network virtualization emerges as a cutting-edge technique to address the limited network capacity problem due to the exponential growth of the mobile data traffic. In addition, the wireless network virtualization can bring huge benefits such as reducing the capital expenditure (CAPEX) and the operational expenditure (OPEX) as well as improving the network capacity. In this regard, one of the key requirements to recognize the benefits of the above mentioned two technologies is to have an applicable resource allocation framework, that enables the deployment of the content caching schemes in the virtualized wireless network. In this study, we investigate a novel joint radio resource allocation and content caching problem to efficiently utilize the radio resource blocks, the transmit power, and the available cache storage at the base stations (BSs). The goal of the formulated problem presented in this paper focuses on minimizing the delays experienced by the end mobile users of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). We show that the formulated problem is a non-convex, mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP), which is NP-hard and simply intractable. Therefore, we deploy the block upper-bound minimization (BSUM) algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Numerical results show that our method outperforms the existing baseline resource allocation schemes, with up to 19% performance gain in terms of network delay.},

abstract = {A single-server queuing-inventory system in which arrivals are governed by a batch Markovian arrival process and successive arrival batch sizes form a finite first-order Markov chain is considered in this paper. Service is provided in batches according to a batch Markovian service process, with consecutive service batch sizes forming a finite first-order Markov chain. A service starts for the next batch on completion of the current service, provided that inventory is available at that epoch; otherwise, there will be a delay in starting the next service. When the service of a batch is completed, the inventory decreases by 1 unit, irrespective of batch size. A control policy in which the server goes on vacation when a service process is frozen until a quorum can initiate the next batch service is proposed to ensure idle-time utilization. During the vacation, the server produces inventory (items) for future services until it hits a specified level L or until the number of customers in the system reaches a maximum service batch size N, with whichever occurring first. In the former case, a server stays idle once the processed inventory level reaches L until the number of customers reaches (or even exceeds because of batch arrival) a maximum service batch size N. The time required for processing one unit of inventory follows a phase-type distribution. In this paper, the steady-state probability vector of this infinite system is computed. The distributions of inventory processing time in a vacation cycle, idle time in a vacation cycle, and vacation cycle length are found. The effect of correlation in successive inter-arrival times and service times on performance measures for such a queuing system is illustrated with a numerical example. An optimization problem is considered. The proposed system is then compared with a queuing-inventory system without the Markov-dependent assumption on successive arrivals as well as service batch sizes using numerical examples.},

abstract = {Methods of queueing theory are often used for telecommunication systems performance evaluation. According to this approach, all MAC and PHY layer protocols details are modelled with a given service time distribution, and the precision of the estimated properties depends on this distribution function selection. While for Ethernet and wireless relay networks the service time is roughly equal to the sum of packet and headers sizes divided by the channel bitrate, it is not so easy to estimate the service time for wireless networks channels based on CSMA/CA including IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) and IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) due to random exponential backoff and collisions. In this paper we use a simple model of the saturated channel described as a semi-Markov random absorbing process, which is based on Bianchi model [2]. We use this process to find a service time phase-type (PH) distribution matching the first two moments of the semi-Markov process. We also use channel simulation model to sample transmission delays in unsaturated mode and find another PH-distribution using G-FIT [12] algorithm. Then we use these PH-distributions to estimate end-to-end delays, queue sizes and nodes utilization in a multi-hop wireless network with linear topology using queueing network. All results are compared to wireless network simulation model, and demonstrate the cases in which the queueing network tends to provide results close to real network performance.},

abstract = {The queueing theory has been a challenging and interesting topic in recent years and has been applied to a variety of application scenarios. In this paper, a delay predictor based on queueing models combined with survival analysis is developed for customers waiting outside the restaurant. In addition to classic queueing models such as LES (Last Customer Enter Service) and HOL (Head of Line), as the circumstances inside the restaurant has an impact on the waiting line outside, this work uses Cox model in survival analysis to estimate the service time further more delay time as SOS (Status of Service) model and cascade the queueing models with regression model GBRT (Gradient Boosting Regression Tree). Experimental results show that the predictor works well and this design has been used in reality.},

@article{Sandmann2012,
abstract = {In almost all applications of queueing network models it is assumed that for each customer the service times at different network nodes are independent. But service times in, for instance, computer and communication networks are typically essentially determined by properties like message or packet lengths that do not change substantially on the route through the network. Therefore, the service times of any customer in a queueing network are likely to be correlated, which can significantly influence quality of service (QoS) properties and performance measures such that results obtained with the independence assumption may be misleading. We consider delays in a series of queues with correlated service times at each network node where for each customer the service time at the first node is a random variable and the successive service times are correlated with the one at the first node. A recursive scheme for delays is provided. This scheme is used in order to efficiently conduct a simulation study where two types of correlation are studied, namely identical service times, and service times with an additional Gaussian noise. The simulation study focuses on comparisons of end-to-end delays for independent service times at different nodes and correlated service times, respectively. It turns out that for both correlation types, in light traffic the delays in case of correlated service times are larger than for independent service times by a factor that first increases with increasing traffic intensity up to a maximum value approached in medium traffic after which it decreases quickly and drops down to become significantly smaller than one in heavy traffic. This effect intensifies with increasing number of network nodes and depends, as well as the crossover point from which on correlated service times yield smaller delays, on the distribution of the service times at the first node. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We prove the existence of limiting distributions for a large class of Markov chains on a general state space in a random environment. We assume suitable versions of the standard drift and minorization conditions. In particular, the system dynamics should be contractive on the average with respect to the Lyapunov function and large enough small sets should exist with large enough minorization constants. We also establish that a law of large numbers holds for bounded functionals of the process. Applications to queuing systems, to machine learning algorithms and to autoregressive processes are presented.},

@article{Baumann2017,
abstract = {We consider multi-server tandem queues where both stations have a finite buffer and all services times are phase-type distributed. Arriving customers enter the first queueing station if buffer space is available or get lost otherwise. After completing service in the first station customers proceed to the second station if buffer space is available, otherwise a server at the first station is blocked until buffer space becomes available at the second station. We provide an exact computational analysis of various steady-state performance measures such as loss and blocking probabilities, expectations and higher moments of numbers of customers in the queues and in the whole system by modeling the tandem queue as a level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death process and applying suitable matrix-analytic methods. Numerical results are presented for selected representative examples.},

abstract = {In daily banking customer queues, unknown waiting-time could lower customer experience. Little's Law formula in Queue Theory provides a generic formula for waiting-time, but it cannot be implemented directly to give finite wait-time estimation in real-life. This study aims to investigate predictive variables that explain waiting-time duration. This paper uses Fast Artificial Neural Network engine to implement Artificial Neural Networks method. To train Artificial Neural Networks, Resilient Propagation was used. Time-series approach and structural approach for input neuron was compared. Average duration from previous interval and number of server was proposed to increase structural variable like Queue Length and Head of Line Duration estimator variable. To determine the best configuration for number of neuron in input and hidden layer, experimental method was used. The results of this study show that structural approach provides better estimation than time-series approach. Furthermore, modified helper variable combination provides a more refined result.},
